/*
 * This file contains functions used for writing the final string into the file
 * of choice. Writers is part of the postprocessor step, and while the postprocessor
 * function handles the arrangement of the output, the writer writes it and will
 * handle markers which provide additional formatting like bolding, italcs, and tables.
 *
 * This quite possibly had to be the single most annoying thing to write. Not the thing
 * thath andles the bold and italics, but rather just the tables and lists. Most of my
 * frustration comes from my own doing, which is that in the manual pages, I have .br's
 * put in between each line. This is fine for the most part, but the problem is that
 * it adds them in between the table and list markers.
 *
 * This on its own is not that big of a problem, but I do want to have fairly strict
 * rules on the formatting of tables and lists. Specifically, tables and lists should
 * not have any arbitrary text / whitespace in between each element / segment. Adding
 * .br's throws a wrench in that.
 * 
 * What I have decided to do to combat this is to have the function which adds breaks
 * in between each line execute an error checking function which will scan the input
 * string its given to write and detect any unclosed tables or lists. When this is
 * done, the break adder can reliably REFUSE to add .br's inside of the lines of a
 * table or list, and then when it comes time to translate the table syntax, I can
 * parse and produce errors for it.
 *
 * Errors are also fairly difficult. The strings the postprocessing functions have
 * access to are several layers above the actual cursors used to extract tokens
 * from the source and header files, and by the time its in the postprocessor, it
 * is impractical to determine which line belongs to which part because of the
 * potential of empty lines being in the comment, which are ignored by the
 * extractors, so at the very least we have to settle for errors like
 * "docgen: expected x but got y\n" for now, unfortunately. Despite this, we can
 * still have actual errors produced by the extractor code. Maybe in the future
 * we could have the extractor code produce errors for invalid table layouts?
