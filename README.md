# docgen

So, it is finally here. It works, and that is all that matters (for now). Does it work well? We will find out.
It will not be like this forever, just.. for now.

No documentation for now. Eventually, but not for now.

Note that this is the rewrite of Docgen. If you need the old version, use the "docgen_legacy" branch.
