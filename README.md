# docgen

Docgen is a utility program for generating documentation from the source
code of a program. While docgen is mainly intended to produce manual pages (it
is very easy to see the UNIX heritage in the some parts of the internal
structure of docgen), it can also produce documentation in arbitrary formats
as long as a backend exists for it.

Docgen is written in highly portable ANSI C, and is known to compile on the
following platforms:
