# CHANGELOG.md

VERSION: 1.0.6
DATE: June 18th, 2022

## Features
- You can now generate documentation for macro functions with the `macros`
  category.

## Bug Fixes
- No longer raises an EOF error for a file where the comment is the only
  thing in the file. This was caused because the end of the C comment was
  quite literally at the end of the file.

## Misc
- License changed-- now using the C-Ware License.

## Documentation
No documentation changes.
